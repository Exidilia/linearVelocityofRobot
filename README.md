"# linearVelocityofRobot" 

This code calculates the linear velocity of a robotic arm.
it's not too complicated but it probably needs a basic knowledge over jacobian matrix and concepts related to robotics.

It uses three simple but important libraries: numpy, math and matplotlib.

I will improve the code as I'm learning how to use git and github.
(go easy on me while I have zero knowledge of the formalities in here)
